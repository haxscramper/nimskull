  Nilability* = enum
    ## Nilability : if a value is nilable. we have maybe nil and nil, so we
    ## can differentiate between cases where we know for sure a value is
    ## nil and not otherwise we can have Safe, MaybeNil Parent: is because
    ## we just use a sequence with the same length instead of a table, and
    ## we need to check if something was initialized at all: if Parent is
    ## set, then you need to check the parent nilability if the parent is
    ## nil, then for now we return MaybeNil unreachable is the result of
    ## add(Safe, Nil) and others it is a result of no states left, so it's
    ## usually e.g. in unreachable else branches?

    Safe
