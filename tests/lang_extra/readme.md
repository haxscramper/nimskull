Language specification test that aim for a wide coverage to supplement
already existing specification details in the `lang/` directory.

Test here have a much looser organization and aim to cover edge cases
for elements that are already specificed. This can be seen as an extra
precaution or a staging ground before particular test can be moved to
the specification.

By "moving to the specification" we mean specifically -- has a clear 
explanation of the involved language features, can be precisely placed 
in one of the spec subdirectories.
