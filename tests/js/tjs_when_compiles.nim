    Compiler crash when using jsffi and compiles
  . Combining the jsffi module with compiles statements involving dot calls
    can crash the compiler
  . The compiler crash only happens when the compiles calls fails.
    Changing the example where the same expression is valid avoids a crash
  . The problem seems to be caused by the `.` macro"
